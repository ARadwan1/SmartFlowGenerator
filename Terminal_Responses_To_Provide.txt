# Amadeus Terminal Response Layouts Needed

Please paste an example of the full terminal response for each of the following commands directly below the corresponding heading.

Make sure to preserve the EXACT spacing, line breaks, and formatting from the terminal, as the Smart Flow `capture` command relies on exact line/column/length coordinates. Use code blocks if necessary.
