1. Getting started with Productivity Suite
What is Productivity Suite?
Productivity Suite is a suite of tools that increases the quality of the booking file (or PNR in 
cryptic mode) by streamlining the overall booking flow. Each tool can be activated or 
deactivated individually, which means each agency can choose only the tools it requires.
Productivity Suite consists of the following tools:

What user roles are available in Productivity Suite?
Role
Description
User
This role is assigned by default to any agent who requires access to Selling Platform 
Connect.
Any user can perform the following actions with Productivity Suite tools:
 l Run Smart Flows.
 l Create and manage personal Smart Flows.
Office 
Administrator
This role is assigned specifically to an office administrator.
An office administrator can perform the following actions with Productivity Suite 
tools:
 l Create and manage personal and office Smart Flows.
 l Share or stop sharing items.
An office administrator can be granted the rights to manage all the Productivity Suite 
tools or to manage individual tools only.
Explanation: main list page
The Main List page is the default page for each Productivity Suite tool. It displays all the items 
that have been created at user or office level.
For each item, the Created in column shows the office in which the item was created. Items can 
be shared with other offices. For more information, see Sharing items in productivity suite on 
page 9.
You can sort the columns in the list by clicking the title bars. The buttons at the bottom allow 
you to manage items, depending on the tool you are using.

Example: Main list page for Smart Flows
If you are an office administrator, the Switch to Sharing View link is also displayed at the 
bottom of the list of office-level items.
How is credit card information stored in Productivity Suite?
Credit card information is stored in a non-encrypted format. Therefore, you should not add 
credit card numbers to any content in Productivity Suite.
Some Smart Flows accept input during run time. If the required input is a credit card number, 
this information is sent to the central system and encrypted immediately.
However, you should not store any credit card number as source code of the Smart Flow 
because this is not encrypted.

3. Smart Flows
What is the Smart Flows tool?
The Smart Flows tool allows a user or office administrator to build and launch predefined, 
customisable workflows.
Smart Flows are triggered on request to help users complete repetitive booking and fulfilment 
tasks.
You can create Smart Flows at the following levels:
 l Personal
The Smart Flow is only available to the user who creates it. Any user can create and edit a 
personal Smart Flow.
 l Office
The Smart Flow can be made available to other users in the same office. You must have the 
office administrator role to create, share and edit an office Smart Flow.
What are the prerequisites for accessing Smart Flows?
The optional Productivity Suite module must be activated by a site parameter before you can 
access Smart Flows.
How to access Smart Flows

What are the two types of editor in Smart Flows?
 l Smart Flow Editor
This editor  is available to users and office administrators.
It allows you to enter cryptic commands and easily add questions and variables to these 
commands.
 l Advanced Language Editor
This editor  is only available to office administrators. 
It allows you to create a Smart Flow using a specific language defined for Smart Flows. For 
more information, see What is the Smart Flow advanced language? below.
You can also test a Smart Flow directly from the Advanced Language Editor before saving it. 
See How to Test a Smart Flow.
Switching between editors
You can only switch between editors if you are an office administrator.
When you first create a new Smart Flow that has not yet been saved, you can switch from the 
Smart Flow Editor to the Advanced Language Editor by clicking on the Advanced Language 
Editor link. Provided you have not saved any changes in the Advanced Language Editor, you 
can undo the switch and return to the Smart Flow Editor by clicking on Undo Changes and Go 
Back to Smart Flow Editor. However, you will lose any changes you made in the Advanced 
Language Editor.
When you reopen an existing Smart Flow, it opens in the editor that it was last saved in. If it 
opens in the Advanced Language Editor, you can no longer switch between editors.
What is the Smart Flow advanced language?
The Smart Flow advanced language is a logical syntax language that is compiled by structuring 
specific statements in basic sentence format. It is used to create Smart Flows in the Advanced 
Language Editor, and it is an alternative to the default Smart Flow Editor that uses commands 
to build Smart Flows.
You can only use the Smart Flow advanced language using the Advanced Language Editor if 
you are an office administrator.
For more information about using the Smart Flow advanced language, see Reference: Smart 
Flow Advanced Language Syntax.
Running and stopping Smart Flows

4. Smart Triggers
What is the Smart Triggers tool?
Smart Triggers is a tool that launches extensions such as scripts or Smart Flows in Selling 
Platform Connect. For example, a Smart Trigger can be a rule that triggers the launch of a script 
when a certain command is entered in the prompt of the Command Page. 
The different types of extensions that can be run are: 
 l Smart Flows
 l Plus scripts
 l Server-side scripts
 l Smart Tools
Smart Flows and server-side scripts are advanced options that must be enabled by a site 
parameter.
You must be an office administrator to define rules using the Smart Triggers tool.

What are the different types of Smart Triggers?
Smart Trigger Type
Description
Smart trigger on 
command match
These Smart Triggers are used to launch a script instead of the standard 
response of a cryptic command.
They intercept the command and launch the script.
There is no response match on these Smart Triggers because there is no 
response from the Amadeus central system.
Smart trigger on 
response match
These Smart Triggers are used to launch a script in addition to the standard 
response of a cryptic command.
They do not intercept the command but launch the script in addition to the 
result of the cryptic command.
When creating this trigger type, the cryptic commands are filtered depending 
on response type and response match.
For more information see Explanation: Smart Trigger Editor Fields.
You can also create a Smart Trigger that combines both types of trigger: command match and 
response match.
In the following example, the Smart Trigger intercepts any cryptic command beginning with 
NM. If the response in the Command Page contains the words INVALID FORMAT, the Smart 
Trigger launches an office Smart Flow to help the user add a passenger using the correct 
format.

8. Adding missing elements using file 
finishing
What is file finishing?
The File Finishing tool in Productivity Suite allows an office administrator to build business rules 
that add missing elements to a booking file.
When File Finishing rules are executed, the relevant mid- and back-office information is added 
to the booking file without any action from the user.
When are file finishing rules executed?
File Finishing rules are executed when a user enters one of the following in the Command Page 
or its graphical equivalent in the booking file:
 l ET
 l ER
 l ERK
 l ETK
The user will then see the results of the File Finishing rules in the Command Page or booking 
file.
If the Intelligent rule sending feature for File Finishing is activated, and a booking file is saved 
multiple times, File Finishing only executes the matching rules once. If Intelligent rule sending is 
not activated, File Finishing executes all the matching rules every time the booking file is saved.
